# NOVAMED Clinic Appointment Booking System

This application simulates appointment services for an imaginary clinic group called **NOVAMED**, supporting roles such as **patients**, **doctors**, **desk staff**, and **admins**.

Users can **create**, **update**, **delete**, or **view** appointments. It uses a **local MySQL database**, but can work with any relational database using the appropriate .NET packages.

---

## Application Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

### üîπ Backend

- Built with **ASP.NET 8**
- Handles all business logic, API routes, and database operations
- Refer to the backend's own `README.md` for detailed instructions on installation, usage, and available endpoints

### üîπ Frontend

- Built with **Next.js v14**
- Responsible for the user interface
- Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Detailed documentation provided in the frontend's `README.md`

---

## Install and Run the Application

You can start the full application using either an **automatic** or **manual** method.

### üöÄ A. Automatic Startup

In the **root folder**, the application uses the `concurrently` package to start both backend and frontend.

#### Steps:

1. Navigate to the root folder.
2. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs the `concurrently` package.

3. Ensure your `package.json` in the root folder looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "your-application-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently -k -n FRONT,BACK -c green,blue \"npm run front\" \"npm run back\"",
    "front": "npm --prefix front_end run dev",
    "back": "dotnet watch run --project back-end"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "concurrently": "^9.1.2"
  }
}
```

---

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to `back-end/` folder.
2. Run:

```bash
dotnet build
```

3. Create `appsettings.json`. See backend README for details.
4. Apply database migrations as required.
5. Start backend manually if needed. Swagger UI should be available at:

```
http://localhost:<your-port>/swagger/index.html
```

> Default port is `5196`, verify before proceeding.

---

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to `front_end/` folder.
2. Create a `.env.local` file. An example format is available in the frontend section.
3. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all necessary frontend dependencies.

Ensure your frontend `package.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "front_end",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@daypilot/daypilot-lite-react": "^3.33.1",
    "animate.css": "^4.1.1",
    "lucide-react": "^0.511.0",
    "next": "14.1.0",
    "react": "^18",
    "react-dom": "^18"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.0.1",
    "eslint": "^8",
    "eslint-config-next": "14.1.0",
    "postcss": "^8",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.0",
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}
```

---

## Run Application (Auto Mode)

Once all dependencies are installed:

1. Ensure you're in the **root** folder.
2. Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Backend and frontend will start simultaneously.
- **Frontend logs** will appear in **green**, and **backend logs** in **blue** in the console.
